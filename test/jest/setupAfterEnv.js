// We can extend `expect` using custom matchers as defined by:
// https://jest-bot.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html#expectextendmatchers
//
// As recommended by `jest-extended`
// (https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended) we're going to place this
// inside of the `setupFilesAfterEnv` option for Jest. If we used the default
// `setupFiles` option, we would be unable to hook into the testing framework
// that is loaded in after those files are run.
//
// For more information, check out the docs here:
